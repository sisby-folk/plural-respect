## Establishing Foundations

### Plurality

Conventionally, we treat a human body and an identity as a one-to-one relationship. 
A body represents (or, contains) one person, and while they may change over time, they remain the same individual. 
This "singlet" model of identity suits the majority of the population. 
However, there is a significant minority (roughly 1 in 50) that instead utilise a "plural" model.
These **plural systems** identify multiple "selves" within their body, each with recognisable traits such as attitude, preferences, memory, or even (by exchanging control of their body) voices, skills, and relationships.

### Terminology

- **Headmates** - the individuals that comprise a plural system (aka its *members*) - used similarly to "roommates". May or may not be able to communicate with one another.
- **Fronting** - A system member possessing control of the body they're in (i.e. being "in the front" of the body; at the wheel.)
- **Switching** - Headmates exchanging control of the body (i.e "switching in" to the front and "switching out" to the back). Some plural systems do not experience this phenomenon, and instead have a permanent front.

### Relevance

As with non-conventional differences in gender or sexuality (or anything else perceived as "in the brain"), plurality is largely met with skepticism.
Where diagnoses like DID (previously Multiple Personality Disorder) invite dismissing plurality as an invalid delusion that needs to be "fixed", plural systems without a diagnosis (or plural experiences not classified under DID) are equally dismissed as unprincipled attention-seeking.

As such, it's productive to understand that plurality is a new term, but one that seeks to describe pre-existing phenomena.
Those that choose to use a plural identity model do so because it's the most comfortable way to describe their personal experiences - in many cases, it's the only way they can explain them at all.
What exactly those experiences are take a back seat to the system's own decision that this model helps make sense of themselves.
Of course, those with experiences that some model as plural may instead feel comfortable under a singlet model, and many utilizing a plural model do so purely on a personal level, with no desire to share that understanding socially - the goal of plurality as a movement is not to push others to utilze a plural identity model, but to help people be understood, and to help people understand themselves.

### Respect

Plurality is an umbrella and model to help understand and provide support for those with specific, undeniably human experiences - whether they're personally understood as medical, spiritual, cultural, or psychological.
Plurality is also a movement: advocating for plural systems' right to exist, be recognized and understood, and have the same autonomy, privacy, and participation in life as any singlet does - just like many other acceptance movements before us.
