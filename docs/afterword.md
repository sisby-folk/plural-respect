## Afterword

### Plural Self-Respect

We hope this primer was sufficient to impart you with the understanding that speaking for the experience of every system is very difficult.
You're more than welcome to stop right here! But to the aforementioned difficulty, we acknowledge that we brushed over and barely touched topics with a lot of depth to them - topics where it's more appropriate to individually speak to our personal experience and understanding, rather than act as an unbiased explainer.

The chapters following this afterword are _Plural Self-Respect_.
A mix of informal ramblings and formal micro-essays written by individual systems and members - Plural Respect's authors, editors, and their friends.
With the intuition from the primer, we hope you can interpret the potential for experiences differing to the ones within these pages, but still derive value from more detailed, personal writing.

We expect this section to expand over time - feel free to skim them in any order.

### _Aside:_ 2.0

This primer is a 2024 rewrite of the original 2022 _plural respect_ - made with less redundancy, more consistency, more conviction, a better understanding of ourselves, and of course - the help of our friends.
1.0 is long, meandering, and at times incorrect - but is available <a href="https://pluralrespect.neocities.org/v1/#" data-wm-adjusted="done">here</a> with even _less_ warranty - just in case it's more complete.

Since **2.1**, _plural respect_ is now appropriate as a standalone plurality primer, owing to various adjustments and the addition of the foundations chapter.
This replaces linking to [More Than One](https://morethanone.info/), which is still a strong, widely propagated resource that's especially useful for skeptics or those you'd like to avoid presenting the depth that plural respect touches on to.
